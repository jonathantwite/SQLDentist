This guide is intended to be a series of short articles targetting those developers who have to develop applications using Microsoft's SQL Server.

The analogy of a Dentist's reception is used to describe how and why a database works.

No knowledge is assumed, however the guide does broach on some intermediate-level topics including query optimisation and how the database uses memory.  When read in order, a beginner should have no issue building their knowledge to the required level.  If not, let me know so I can do something about it!

Although there are some articles that broach into the domain of the Database Administrator (DBA), these mostly are where fundamental knowledge, or where significant performance gains can be gained when programming with such knowledge.
